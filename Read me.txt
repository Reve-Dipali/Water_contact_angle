Water Contact Angle

Environment:
There's a glass plate having a microscope camera at one side and LED lihts on the other side.
And on that glass plate water drop's images will be captured

I need to work:
- Make a software to Find out angle of the water droplet by drawing perpendicular on 
  both the sides of droplet (where the droplet ends)
- After we get the angle need to apply formula to find out wether it's hydrophobic or philic
- Also need to keep an threshold while capturing through microscope that if the alignment of 
  droplet and microscope is not proper it will not capture the data at all (this will be 
  applied later on, once the above 2 priority tasks are completed)


Improvements to be done:
- Create baseline from 1st 2 points (p1, p2) and extending it.
- Now once te baseline is drawn, draw perpendicular on those points (p1, p2) and then mark 
  the other 2 points (p3, p4).
- Draw lines of p3 and p4 and calulate the angle between p1-p3 and p2-p4.


New:
- Angle is to be done from the baseline and not perpendicular.
- Draw line of p3 and p4 instead of points.
- zoom in - zoom out option for images.
